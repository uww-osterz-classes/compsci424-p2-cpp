// Remember: use <angle brackets> for standard C++ headers/libraries
// and "double quotes" for headers in the same directory as this file.
#include <iostream>

// You might be able to complete this program using only one C++ code
// file and no additional .h files. You might not need to write any of
// your own classes for this program.

// In addition to the main function, you will need one function for the 
// producer thread and one function for the consumer thread. You might
// find it helpful to write more functions, too.

int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {
    // Main program goes here. The required steps have been copied into
    // this file as comments. Feel free to add more comments to help
    // you understand your code, or for any other reason.

    // 1. Ask the user to enter the three parameters described in the
    // Parameters section, then receive those parameters. Use a 
    // separate prompt message and a separate input call for each
    // parameter.


    // 2. Create the buffer and initialize each element to 0.


    // 3. To confirm that each element is initialized, display the
    // contents of the buffer on one long line. There should be one
    // 0 value for each buffer element. See the Program 2 page on
    // Canvas for the required format.


    // 4. Create and start the producer thread.


    // 5. Create and start the consumer thread.


    // 6. After 90 seconds, send a signal to the producer and consumer
    // threads to stop running. (Alternatively, you may have the
    // producer and consumer threads keep track of time and stop
    // themselves 90 seconds after they start running.)


    // 7. Display the values in the buffer. Use the format that is shown
    // on the Program 2 page on Canvas.


    // 8. Do any necessary "cleanup" work.
